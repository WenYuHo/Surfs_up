## Overview of the analysis: 
- Prepare an analysis so that our project manager can use weather data to persuade stake holders that our desired locations
are ideal to set up surfing stations.
- Extract data from SQLite using python libraries for exploration.
- Eventually create a pipeline for future analysis and a simple website for demostration.
- Focus query on June and December.

## Result:
- June and December in our locations have identical temperature statstic.
- June is within 64~77 fahrenheit 50% of the time and December is within 69 ~ 74 50% of the time
- Overall, June is slightly cooler than December.
